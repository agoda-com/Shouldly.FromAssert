Because life's too short for hard-to-read assertions! 🔍

## What is this?

Shouldly.FromAssert is a Roslyn analyzer that helps you migrate from traditional NUnit assertions to the more human-readable [Shouldly](https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly) library. It's like having a friendly code review buddy who's really into making tests more readable (but doesn't drink your coffee).

## Features

- Automatically detects NUnit assertions and suggests Shouldly alternatives
- Provides code fixes to transform assertions with a single click
- Supports a wide range of assertion types:
  - Basic assertions (`Assert.AreEqual` → `ShouldBe`)
  - String assertions (`StringAssert.Contains` → `ShouldContain`)
  - Collection assertions (`CollectionAssert.Contains` → `ShouldContain`)
  - Type assertions (`Assert.IsInstanceOf` → `ShouldBeOfType`)
  - And many more!

## Installation

```shell
dotnet add package Shouldly.FromAssert
```

## Usage

1. Install the package
2. Write your tests as usual with NUnit
3. Look for the analyzer suggestions (they'll appear as warnings)
4. Click the lightbulb 💡 or press (Alt+Enter or Ctrl+. depending on the IDE religeon you practice)
5. Select "Convert to Shouldly"
6. Watch your assertions transform into beautiful, readable Shouldly statements

### Before and After

```csharp
// Before: 😕
Assert.That(contestant, Is.EqualTo(1337));
CollectionAssert.Contains(contestants, winner);
StringAssert.StartsWith("Hello", greeting);

// After: 😊
contestant.ShouldBe(1337);
contestants.ShouldContain(winner);
greeting.ShouldStartWith("Hello");
```

## Supported Conversions

Here are some examples of the transformations this analyzer can perform:

| NUnit                                              | Shouldly                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `Assert.That(x, Is.EqualTo(y))`                    | `x.ShouldBe(y)`                           |
| `Assert.IsTrue(x > 10)`                            | `(x > 10).ShouldBeTrue()`                 |
| `Assert.IsNull(x)`                                 | `x.ShouldBeNull()`                        |
| `CollectionAssert.Contains(list, item)`            | `list.ShouldContain(item)`                |
| `StringAssert.StartsWith("Hi", str)`               | `str.ShouldStartWith("Hi")`               |
| `Assert.Throws<ArgumentException>(() => method())`  | `Should.Throw<ArgumentException>(() => method())` |

And many more! Check out the tests for a complete list of supported conversions.
